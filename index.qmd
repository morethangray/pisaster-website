## Meet your quant

Hi, I’m Morgan Gray, the ecologist behind Pisaster. I bring 15 years of experience in quantitative ecology and a passion for clear, beautiful communication. I use code to handle big data sets, math to understand the ecology within the records, and design to share the results. I started Pisaster to use this unique combination of skills to empower conservation organizations by turning monitoring data into actionable, evidence-based insights, thereby providing the insights land managers need to make informed, on-the-ground decisions for biodiversity stewardship.
