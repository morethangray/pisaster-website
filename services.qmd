## Our services 

We help conservation organizations make sense of ecological data. While we specialize in wildlife monitoring and connectivity mapping, we work on projects of all kinds — from organizing complex datasets to creating clear, meaningful visualizations. Whether you’re building a new study or making use of existing data, we provide practical, thoughtful support to turn information into insight.

### Wildlife data analysis

Go beyond raw numbers to understand the story your data is telling. We can help you design effective monitoring programs and analyze the results. Experience working with a range of wildlife data types, including wildlife camera detections; observations in repositories and collections like iNaturalist and GBIF; locations from radio/GPS collars and transect surveys; and genetic markers.
