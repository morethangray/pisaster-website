### Morgan Gray, PhD {#bio}
[Principal and Quantitative Ecologist]{.highlight-offset-teal}

Working with ecological data is about more than numbers. It’s about understanding the questions that matter to you, the people protecting our landscapes and wildlife. 

As the Principal of Pisaster, I draw on 15 years of experience in ecological data analysis and time in the nonprofit sector to turn complex data into meaningful conservation outcomes. I understand the challenges organizations face when turning monitoring data into effective decisions. That’s where I can help.

I specialize in terrestrial mammal monitoring analysis and connectivity mapping, but my work extends to any project involving ecological data. Whether it’s cleaning long-term datasets, building reproducible workflows, designing studies, or creating clear, useful visualizations, I’m here to support your work with reliable and innovative analysis.

<!-- Clients value my ability to distill complex science into plain language. I offer thoughtful, collaborative guidance that fosters discovery.  -->

My goal is to make the data side of conservation easier, so you can stay focused on the on-the-ground stewardship you care about most. I'm committed to ensuring your data works as hard as you do for biodiversity protection.
