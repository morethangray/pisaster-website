    "text": "Morgan Gray, PhD\nPrincipal and Quantitative Ecologist\nWorking with ecological data is about more than numbers — it’s about understanding the questions that matter to the people protecting our landscapes and wildlife.\nWith 15 years of experience in ecological data analysis and time in the nonprofit sector, I understand the challenges conservation organizations face when turning monitoring data into meaningful decisions. That’s where I can help.\nI specialize in wildlife monitoring analysis and connectivity mapping, but my work extends to any project involving ecological data. Whether it’s cleaning long-term datasets, building reproducible workflows, designing studies, or creating clear, useful visualizations, I’m here to support your work with practical, reliable analysis.\nClients value my ability to explain results in plain language and offer thoughtful, collaborative guidance. My goal is to make the data side of conservation easier, so you can stay focused on the work you care about most.\nWhether you’re looking for help with a specific analysis or ongoing support, I’m here to make sure your data works as hard as you do for conservation.\n\nEducation\nPhD in Environmental Science, Policy & Management | UC Berkeley \nBA in Integrative Biology | UC Berkeley\n\n\nLinks"
