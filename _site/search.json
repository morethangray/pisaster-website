    "text": "Principal and Quantitative Ecologist\nMaking ecological data work for conservation is about more than numbers—it’s about understanding what matters to the people working to protect our landscapes and wildlife.\nAfter 15 years in ecological data analysis and time in the nonprofit sector, I’ve seen how organizations struggle to transform monitoring data into conservation action. That’s where I come in.\nI specialize in wildlife monitoring analysis and connectivity mapping, but I work on any project involving ecological data. From cleaning datasets to creating automated workflows, from study design to compelling visualizations—if data is slowing down your conservation work, I can help.\nWhat sets my work apart is making complex concepts accessible. I explain results in plain language and create clear visuals so you understand what the data means and why it matters. Clients appreciate my combination of statistical rigor with a collaborative, practical approach.\nWhether you need help with a specific analysis or ongoing support, I’m here to make sure your data works as hard as you do for conservation.\nAfter 15 years in ecological data analysis, I’ve seen firsthand how dedicated conservation organizations can get bogged down by data. Too often, vital information from monitoring programs stays locked in spreadsheets, failing to become the engine for meaningful action that it should be.\nI started Pisaster to bridge that gap. My focus is on taking the stress out of the scientific process so you can concentrate on what you do best. I specialize in making complex concepts accessible, explaining results in plain language, and creating clear visuals so you always understand what the numbers mean and why they matter.\nMy clients appreciate that I bring both statistical rigor and a practical, collaborative style to every project. I’m here to be your partner, ensuring your data works as hard as you do for conservation.\n\n\nPhD in Environmental Science, Policy & Management | UC Berkeley \nBA in Integrative Biology | UC Berkeley"
